# Kotlin Shopping Companion Application

This Android application, crafted using Kotlin, is an engaging shopping platform for categorically organized products such as Clothing, Footwear, and Accessories. It allows users to browse through categories, select products, and add them to their cart for a seamless shopping experience.

## Description

The Kotlin Shopping Companion is a user-friendly app designed to simulate an online shopping experience. It features a selection of product categories and a dynamically updating list of items that users can explore and add to their shopping cart. This application does not integrate a database, hence, it utilizes in-memory lists and arrays for managing the data.

## Features

- **Categorized Browsing**: Users can browse products by selecting categories from a dropdown spinner.
- **Dynamic Product Selection**: A second spinner lists the available products within the selected category.
- **Product Details**: For each product chosen, the app displays an image, name, and a detailed description.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Includes the ability to add products to a virtual shopping cart.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: An interface that is easy to navigate and visually appealing, enhancing the user's shopping experience.

## How to Use

1. Open the app on your Android device.
2. Use the first spinner to choose a category like 'Footwear'.
3. The second spinner will then show the products available in that category.
4. Upon selecting a product, view its details, including an image and description.
5. Add the product to your cart with the 'Add to cart' button.
6. The shopping cart can be reviewed and modified at any time before checkout.
